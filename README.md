# ROT Decoder

ROT Decoder is a mini-program that reads in a text file containing an encoded message. It then creates a new text file and writes out the decoded message. 

## IMPORTANT

ROT Decoder includes text files provided by Utah State University's computer science department to which I give credit. Major functionality code is my own work. 

## Running Top Films

Run main.cpp using with prefered C++ IDE. secretMessage.txt contains the the encoded message to be decoded. 


## Built With

* [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) - C++ IDE used.


## Authors

* **Ross Allen** - *Major functionality/displayment code*

## Acknowledgments

Again, some starter-code was provided by Utah State University's CS department for the purpose of this assignment.
